## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Redis instance (local or managed)
- API keys for AI providers (see below)
- Supabase account
- Discord webhook (optional but recommended)

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarshMriduhash/Unbound-Team.git
cd unbound-team/backend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `backend/.env`:

```bash
# AI API Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxx

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJxxx

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379

# Discord Notifications (optional)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxx

# Cost Protection
DAILY_SPENDING_CAP=5.00
```

### 3. Start Redis

```bash
# Local Redis
redis-server

# Or use managed Redis (Railway, Upstash, etc.)
```

### 4. Run Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start

# Or for development with auto-reload
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the System

```bash
# Test AI Orchestrator
npm run test

# Test Task Queue
npm run test:queue

# Test Notifications
npm run test:notifications

# Test Lead Generation
node test/test-lead-generation.js
```

### 6. Access Dashboard

Open `dashboard.html` in your browser to monitor the system in real-time.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Lead Generation Example

1. **User submits request** via test-leads.html:
   - Target industry: "high-end business clients seeking business strategist"
   - Location: "global"
   - Count: 10 leads
   - Min fit score: 8/10

2. **AI generates search strategy:**
   - Identifies target subreddits, forums, blogs
   - Creates search queries optimized for target audience
   - Determines scraping priorities

3. **Autonomous scraping:**
   - Reddit communities (r/Entrepreneur, r/startups, etc.)
   - Indie Hackers forums
   - Product Hunt discussions
   - Business strategy blogs

4. **AI enrichment:**
   - Analyzes each lead's content
   - Identifies pain points and challenges
   - Generates fit score (1-10)
   - Creates personalized outreach strategy

5. **Delivery:**
   - CSV export with all lead data
   - JSON format for API integration
   - Summary statistics (avg fit score, sources, etc.)

### Cost Optimization

The AI Orchestrator automatically routes tasks to the cheapest available model:

1. **Gemini 1.5 Flash** (Free, 1500 req/day) - Try first
2. **GPT-4o-mini** ($0.15/1M tokens) - Fallback for simple tasks
3. **Claude Haiku** ($0.25/1M tokens) - Fast decisions
4. **Perplexity** - Research only
5. **Claude Sonnet** - Complex problems (use sparingly)

Daily spending cap prevents runaway costs.
